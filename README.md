# bowl-competition
A collection of PHP scripts that runs a NCAA Football Bowl Competition.

This group of scripts, combined with the appropriate mySQL databse setup, runs the Roanoke College Bowl competition in the fall.  It allows enrollment, sends email information, and has an adminstrative backend to manage donations and results.  The updating of game data can be done manually or automatically through a crontab pull of the autoupdate action (thanks to phillipdwright for the JSON information from ESPN).
